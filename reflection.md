Working on this project, it was helpful to have a base set of code to start with, allowing us to align our edits with the assignment’s requirements. However, I struggled a lot with aligning elements in the boxes to match the provided design. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure it out. I’m pretty sure it was due to a misunderstanding on my part, but I tried nearly everything, and it still didn’t work. I even asked ChatGPT for help, but it had its limitations and couldn’t fully resolve the issue either.

I also found the structure of the HTML and deciding where to place my CSS challenging. Should I inline it, use an external stylesheet, or put it in a specific section? These were questions I kept pondering. Eventually, I went with inline CSS, placing everything in the <head> section. It worked out since all my styles were in one file, and I wasn’t making significant changes to the HTML—just small tweaks here and there.

Using an external stylesheet might have been a cleaner approach, but since I wasn’t frequently switching between files, it didn’t feel necessary. Most of my time was spent experimenting with CSS, and it’s incredibly powerful. However, you really need to practice and have a plan before diving in. I was often guessing, which led to some trial and error. It was a learning process—figuring out what different properties do—but it was also a bit frustrating at times.

And one last thing, I would love if i could highlight was is being changed, like a small hue around what Im currently editing. I KNOW I CAN SEE WHAT IM CHANGING WHEN I CLICK IT BUT BEING ABLE TO SEE 1px to 5px is not a big difference sometimes.
